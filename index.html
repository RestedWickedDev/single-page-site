                        <h3>Electric</h3>
                        <p>Electric guitars have a lot of versatility, but require additional equipment to be played.</p>
                    </li>
					<li class="card">
                        <h3>Acoustic</h3>
                        <p>Acoustic Guitars are cheaper, but they are limited to that sound</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Does it Matter?</h3>
                <p class="card">
                    A common myth is that you should get an acoustic guitar if you are going to learn to play, but you can learn just as well with an electric guitar. So you should pick a guitar from whatever genre you want to play.  As you keep playing you will eventually get more guitars anyway.

				<h2>Learn Technique</h2>
				<p>Once you've gotten a guitar you might be tempted to look up a youtube video to play your favorite song, but while this isn't wrong you will find yourself frustrtated when you realise the song is probably harder than you thought. I recommend you first practice your technique and memorize the fretboard. Let me tell ya, it will seem smaller as you get better. I recommend looking up the Spider Exercises</p>

					<h2>Guitar Tab</h2>
					<p>Learning to read Guitar Tabs is a lot easier than reading sheet music, Many popular songs have tabs written for them</p>

                    <h2>Music Theory</h2>
                    <p>If you want to get even better at guitar, learning some level of music theory can help, Look up some scales on guitar, they all have the same shape, and any note on those scales is fair game when making a riff, chord progression, or solo</p>
